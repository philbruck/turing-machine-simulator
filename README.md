## Project Description

Here you can see a small project of mine: a Turing Machine Simulator provided as a pure browser application. The Turing Machine Simulator illustrates the functionality of Alan Turing's theoretical computing model.

You can define the start tape, start state, end states, and transition rules, and then run your own Turing program. Additionally, you can load predefined configurations to allow for a quick start.

Everything is bundled into a single HTML file: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Normally, it’s not considered a best practice to bundle everything into one file, but I made this decision intentionally to make the usage as simple as possible.

The file also includes a description of Alan Turing’s Turing Machine and documentation on how to configure the simulator.

## Installation

The Turing Machine Simulator can be easily downloaded and run in the browser. No installation, no hassle. The only dependency is Bootstrap's CSS/JavaScript. An internet connection is required for this.

If you want to use the Turing Machine Simulator completely offline, you can download the simulator from the "full-offline-mode" directory, which includes the CSS/JavaScript files (either as a single file or triple file). This way, no internet connection is required anymore.

### Prerequisites:
- Up to date browser


### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/philbruck/turing-machine-simulator.git

2. Use the HTML files you need

## Usage

Simply open the HTML file or access it online and check out the instructions in the navigation bar.
